    <h2><strong>Results</strong></h2>

    <p>Your recommended emergency fund amount is: <span id="emergencyFundAmount"></span></p>

    <p>You should allocate <span id="monthlyAllocation"></span> of your monthly income towards your emergency fund.</p>

    <p>It will take approximately <span id="monthsToReachFund"></span> months to reach your emergency fund goal.</p>

    <h2><strong>Why is this the recommended amount for emergency funds?</strong></h2>
    <p>Financial experts generally recommend having an emergency fund that can cover at least 3 to 6 months of your living expenses. In the case of this calculator, we are assuming a conservative recommendation of 6 times your monthly expenses for the emergency fund.</p>
    <p>An emergency fund provides a safety net for unexpected events such as job loss, medical emergencies, or major repairs. By saving 6 times your monthly expenses, you can ensure that you have enough funds to cover your essential needs for a reasonable period of time if an unexpected financial setback occurs.</p>
    <p>Setting aside a percentage of your monthly income towards your emergency fund helps you build up the necessary funds over time. By consistently allocating a portion of your income, you can gradually reach the desired emergency fund amount and provide yourself with financial security.</p>
    <p>Please note that the recommended amount may vary based on individual circumstances, such as income stability, dependents, and other financial obligations. It's always a good idea to assess your specific needs and consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice.</p>
